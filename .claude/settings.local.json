Root cause was shop parameter\nnot being preserved when navigating between pages.\n\nChanges:\n1. app._index.tsx - Added navigateWithShop() helper function\n2. app.settings.tsx - Updated backAction to include shop parameter\n3. app.tickets.tsx - Updated backAction and primaryAction with shop\n4. app.export.tsx - Updated backAction with shop parameter\n5. app.setup.tsx - Updated backAction with shop parameter\n\nAll routes now properly preserve the shop parameter during navigation,\nenabling buttons and links to work correctly in the embedded app.\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
